# Churn-Modelling-using-Keras
The project teaches us ,how to churn customers data using deep learning libraries like keras and tensorflow. The project contains a small dataset with nominal transaction details for learning purpose. The data is cleaned properly and popular deep learning algorithms  are used to train and test.The required F1 score and accuracy are acquired.
