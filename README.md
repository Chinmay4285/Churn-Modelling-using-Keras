# Churn-Modelling-using-Keras
The project teaches us ,how to churn customers data using deep learning libraries like keras and tensorflow. The project contains a small dataset with nominal transaction details for learning purpose. The data is cleaned properly and popular deep learning algorithms  are used to train and test.The required F1 score and accuracy are acquired.

This folder contains three files,

1.Dataset in .csv format

2.Code in Jupyter notebook (.ipynb)

3.Code in normal python file.

please go through basic deep learning basics before you try to understand this simple code.
